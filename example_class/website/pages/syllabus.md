## ðŸš¢ Getting Started

To get started in DSC 10, you'll need to set up accounts on a couple of
websites.


#### campuswire

We'll be using <a href="https://campuswire.com/p/G383A794D" target="_blank">Campuswire</a>
as our course message board. Campuswire is like
Piazza, but unlike Piazza, Campuswire does not sell student data to third
parties.

You should have received an invitation via email, but if not you can manually
[join our class](https://campuswire.com/p/G383A794D).

I'll be making all announcements via Campuswire posts, so make sure that you
register ASAP.


#### gradescope

We'll be using Gradescope
[gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/143821) for
homework submission and grading. Most of the assignments will be autograded,
meaning that you will write some code, upload it to Gradescope, and a computer
will run your code to verify that it works properly.
